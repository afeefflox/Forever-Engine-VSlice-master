## [0.3.2h]
- Slight optimizations here and there in regards to division;

- Use the "Bar" terminology to refer to chart "sections";
    - Context: the term "section" refer to a larger chunk of a song, not what FNF makes it out to be.
    - What fnf is reffering is a measure, or alternatively, a Bar.

- That's all, folks!
    - Forever was definitely one of a kind, second attempt on a proper FNF rewrite

        it (in a way) exploded, both positively and negatively,

        can't say I didn't have fun contributing to it back when Shubs was rewriting it,

        all 'n all, the hotfix was done to fix some small issues and bring it to its final halt

        Legacy is no longer going to be updated, and as for the other rewrites, it is very unlikely that they will keep going.

        Forever was cool! I'm glad I gave it a chance back in the day, I learned a lot from it

        anyway, this is all!

## [0.3.2]

---

## [0.3]
- Rewritten Hold Notes;
- BPM Changes
    - (credit to [nebulazorua](https://github.com/nebulazorua));
- Rewritten Inputs
    - (Thanks to [ShadowMario](https://github.com/ShadowMario) for letting me borrow some of your scripts, it was more of an afterthought tbh);
- Better Camera Movement
    - (Heavily based on [Vs. Sonic.Exe](https://gamebanana.com/mods/316022));
- Just generally stability and changes to make sure Legacy is at the very least not broken before moving onto 1.0.
