* A lot of modularity and freedom with options
    * (Hopefully in the future *everything* will be toggleable);
* A restructure/partial remake of the base game's codebase;
* ``source/`` folder abstraction;
* More streamlined code (most of them :/)
    * (only having to set things in one place).

* [Pixloen](https://github.com/PixlJacket):

    * gave shubs a lot of advice on how to improve the engine as well as his input on how to improve upon the base game and how the input system felt and such,
    * programmed simply judgements and background darken
    * basically co-owned the engine lmao;
* [Gedehari](https://github.com/gedehari):
    * BANGER ASS PROGRAMER,
